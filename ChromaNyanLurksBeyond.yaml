# Multiworld: Something Lurks Beyond
# Games: A Hat in Time, Undertale Beta, Mega Man 2
# Custom Goals:
#   ChromaHat:
#     Complete the "Boss Rush" death wish contract. Death Wish unlocks after receiving 35 Time Pieces.
#     Boss Rush is the only contract in the shuffle, other than Seal the Deal, which is always last when it is the goal. Seal the Deal does not have to be completed.
#   ChromaTale: 
#     Defeat Toriel, Papyrus, Undyne, and Mettaton, then defeat each route's final boss(es).
#     Toriel, Papyrus, and Mettaton should be spared in pacifist, while Undyne should be killed in genocide. Doing otherwise would be too easy.
#     They can be defeated in the other route first, but this does not count toward the goal until defeated in the listed route, even if doing otherwise still awards the key piece.
#     Plando is used to enforce this to the best of my ability, by putting key pieces on every boss' location.
#     After this is completed, Asgore, Omega Flowey, Sans, and Asriel Dreemurr must all be defeated to goal, identical to vanilla.
#   ChromaMM2:
#     Defeat EVERY boss. This means every robot master in their original stage, all wily stage bosses, and all rematches. After all of that is done, defeat Alien in Wily 6.
#     In other words, check every location.
