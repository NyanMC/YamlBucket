This is a collection of every yaml I have submitted to a community multiworld on the Archipelago Discord server. Yes, all of them.

...well, almost all of them. Anything that I have submitted to a multiworld in the AD server will not show here. Not that I play any AD games, this is more of a precaution.

Why? A better question is "why not"?
