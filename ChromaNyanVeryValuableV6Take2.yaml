# Multiworld: Very Valuable VVVVVV
# Games: VVVVVV, Super Mario 64
# Very Valuable VVVVVV (Take Two) forced important progression items into every VVVVVV slot, and forced important trinkets into other slots.
# This has been emulated here by giving this VVVVVV priority everywhere and non-local everything.
